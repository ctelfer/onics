PML
 + Add "standard include path/files"
 + Add exit() intrinsic.
 + More test cases (control flow especially)
 + Fix code gen error reporting:  no 'fprintf(stderr....)'
 + Proper checking for allocation failures in parser.
 * Optimize binary operations with at least one constant operand.
 * Hash table support
 * Data structure support (maybe just hash tables)
 * random() intrinsic
 ? AST-based interpreter for comparison with code generated version


Proto parsing
 * More checking of ICMP packets by type.
 * Check restrictions on parsing to ensure termination.


x2hpkt:
 * Add field printing for xpkt header


netvm_prog API:
 * Alter format to allow for coprocessor patching.


NetVM:
 ? Revise netvm cmp, pcmp and mskcmp to check lengths

NetVM Coprocessors
 * DNS Resolver coprocessor
 * Hash table coprocessor
 * Backing store coprocessor for packets
 * Coprocessor for RNG
 * Generic C library netvm coprocessor
 + Fix up / test regex compilation on error patterns (catlib).
 ? Create compatible regex coprocessor for other regex libraries.


nvas:
 * Allow full override of all operation values
 * Have disassembler produce memory segment declarations

pktmux/pktdemux:
 * Allow easier specification of sources and sinks rather than just shell 
   operations and conventions.  These are a bit too cumbersome.
