PML
 + warn when local variables shadow globals or packets
 + Add "standard include path/files"
 + More test cases (control flow especially)
 * send-without-free
 * command line arguments to programs
 * random() intrinsic
 > Hash table support
 > Data structure support (maybe just hash tables)


Proto parsing
 * Check restrictions on parsing to ensure termination.
 > More checking of ICMP/ICMPv6 packets by type.
 > MPLS
 > PPP
 > GRE
 > GTP


x2hpkt:
 * Add field printing for xpkt header


netvm_prog API:
 > Alter format to allow for coprocessor patching.


NetVM:
 ? Revise netvm cmp, pcmp and mskcmp to check lengths

NetVM Coprocessors
 + Fix up / test regex compilation on error patterns (catlib).
 * DNS Resolver coprocessor
 * Generic C library netvm coprocessor
 > Hash table coprocessor
 > Backing store coprocessor for packets
 > Coprocessor for RNG
 ? Create compatible regex coprocessor for other regex libraries.


nvas:
 * Have disassembler produce memory segment declarations

pktmux/pktdemux:
 * Allow easier specification of sources and sinks rather than just shell 
   operations and conventions.  These are a bit too cumbersome.
