PML
 + More test cases (control flow especially)
 + unit tests for the standard library
 * for loops
 * 4-byte length when unspecified
 ? proper 'global' variable resolutions in functions and rules
 * command line arguments to programs (requires number parsing to be useful)
 > Either hash table or multi-dimensional array support


Protocol parsing & Namespace
 + Add test test cases to validate basic packet parsing.
 + Add IPv6 extension headers in the namespace.
 * Check restrictions on parsing to ensure termination.
 > Add short-form parsing for protocols using the above.
 > PPP
 > GTP
 > PPOE
 > GENEVE


x2hpkt:
 * Revise/simplify to use regular field printing
 * Handle raw unformatted fields.


netvm_prog API:
 > Add coprocessor patching to the external format & loader.


NetVM Coprocessors
 * DNS Resolver coprocessor
 > Hash table coprocessor
 > Backing store coprocessor for packets


pktmux/pktdemux:
 * Allow easier specification of sources and sinks rather than just shell 
   operations and conventions.  These are a bit too cumbersome. 


pdiff:
 + unit tests
 * Two-column output format
 * pml edit script output format

psort:
 ? subfields of fields
 ? header fields
 ? separate directions for each field

psplit:
 + unit tests

scripts:
 + unit tests

pmerge:
 + implement

nft:
 + unit tests
 + other protocols? (SCTP? DCCP? etc..?)
 * adaptive timeouts based on state tracking

viper: -- VIsual Packet EditoR
 > implement
