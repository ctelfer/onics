PML
 + More test cases (control flow especially)
 + String references to arbitrary 'str' values (constants)
 ? proper 'global' variable resolutions in functions and rules
 ? Add "standard include path/files"
 * command line arguments to programs (requires number parsing to be useful)
 * random() intrinsic
 > Either hash table or multi-dimensional array support


Protocol parsing & Namespace
 * Check restrictions on parsing to ensure termination.
 > Add short-form parsing for protocols using the above.
 > More checking of ICMP/ICMPv6 packets by type.
 > MPLS
 > PPP
 > GRE
 > GTP
 > other tunnel formats


x2hpkt:
 * Revise/simplify to use regular field printing
 * Handle raw unformatted fields.


netvm_prog API:
 > Add coprocessor patching to the external format & loader.


NetVM Coprocessors
 + Fix up / test regex compilation on error patterns (catlib).
 * Timer interrupt
 * DNS Resolver coprocessor
 * Generic C library netvm coprocessor
 > Hash table coprocessor
 > Backing store coprocessor for packets (replaces queue coprocessor)
 > Coprocessor for RNG


pktmux/pktdemux:
 * Allow easier specification of sources and sinks rather than just shell 
   operations and conventions.  These are a bit too cumbersome. 


pdiff:
 + Better payload comparison
 * Two-column output format
 * pml edit script output format
