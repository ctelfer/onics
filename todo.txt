Key:
  + -- Should do this
  * -- Nice to have
  ? -- Not sure if we should do this but should consider

PML
 + Fix up command line options
 + Regular expression matching
 + Formatted printing
 + Add metadata manipulation
 + Add "standard include path/files"
 + More test cases (control flow especially)
 + Fix/allow recursion for functions (not inlines).
 + Fix code gen error reporting:  put somewhere sane.
 + Proper checking for allocation failures in parser.
 ? Revise netvm cmp, pcmp and mskcmp to check lengths ?
 * Optimize binary operations with at least one constant operand.
 * Hash table support
 * Data structure support (maybe just hash tables)
 * AST-based interpreter for comparison with code generated version


Proto parsing
 * More checking of ICMP packets by type.
 * Check restrictions on parsing to ensure termination.


x2hpkt:
 * Add field printing for xpkt header


netvm_prog API:
 * Alter format to allow for coprocessor patching.


netvm:
 * Resolver coprocessor
 * Hash table coprocessor
 * Backing store coprocessor for packets


pktdiff:
 + everything
