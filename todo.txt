PML
 + Formatted printing
 + Add metadata manipulation
 + Fix up command line options
 + Add "standard include path/files"
 + More test cases (control flow especially)
 + Fix code gen error reporting:  no 'fprintf(stderr....)'
 + Proper checking for allocation failures in parser.
 * Optimize binary operations with at least one constant operand.
 * Hash table support
 * Data structure support (maybe just hash tables)
 * AST-based interpreter for comparison with code generated version


Proto parsing
 * More checking of ICMP packets by type.
 * Check restrictions on parsing to ensure termination.


x2hpkt:
 * Add field printing for xpkt header


netvm_prog API:
 * Alter format to allow for coprocessor patching.


netvm:
 ? Revise netvm cmp, pcmp and mskcmp to check lengths

NetVM Coprocessors
 * DNS Resolver coprocessor
 * Hash table coprocessor
 * Backing store coprocessor for packets
 + Fix up / test regex compilation on error patterns (catlib).


pktdiff:
 + everything




Regular expressions in NetVM
 - There are a max # of patterns at one time.  All operations get an error
   if the pattern index is out of bounds.
 - Load Pattern [addr, len, idx] -> []
	* frees previous pattern if present
	* May give an error if we run out of memory or if the pattern
	  requires too many matches.
 - Clear Pattern [idx] -> []
 - Match [addr, len, idx] -> [0 or 1]
	* Error if pattern not loaded
 - MatchX [addr, len, nmatch, idx] ->
	[0]
	[offn, offn-1, offn-2 .. off1, pos]
	* Error if pattern not loaded
	* Error if nmatch is too large for the pattern


Formatted printing in PML
 - print <expr>[:<fmt>]
 - print "Hello ":%15s, "World":%-15s;
 - print ip.daddr:IP, @ipv6{1}.daddr:IP6:-20
 - <fmt> is one of:
    %[<w>]d - signed decimal (scalar, default for scalar)
    %[<w>]u - unsigned decimal (scalar)
    %[<w>]x - unsigned hex (scalar)
    %[<w>]o - unsigned oct (scalar)
    %[<w>]b - binary (scalar)
    %[<w>]s - string (byte string, length == any, default for byte string)
    %[<w>]hex - hex string (byte string, length any)
    %[<w>]ip - IPv4 address (byte string, length == 4)
    %[<w>]ipv6 - IPv6 address (byte string, length == 16)
    %[<w>]eth - 802.11 address (byte string, length == 6)
 - <w> is a positive or negative integer.
   * positive = min width right justify
   * negative = min width left justify
   * starts with 0 = zero-pad to width
