.SH NAME
ipfrag - Fragment IP and IPv6 packets at a given MTU

.SH SYNOPSYS

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBipfrag\fP takes in a stream of XPKT formatted packets, searches for
the IPv4 and/or IPv6 packets in the stream and fragments them to a
specified maximum transmission unit (MTU) size.  The MTU is given as the
number of bytes of the maximum IPv4/IPv6 datagram starting from the IP
header.  \fBipfrag\fP copies datalink headers prior to the IPv4 or IPv6
header verbatim into each new fragment.  If neither \fB-4\fP nor
\fB-6\fP are specified as options, then \fBipfrag\fP defaults to
fragmenting IPv4 packets only.  Otherwise it fragments only those
protocols specified as options.

.SH OPTIONS
.IP "\fB-a\fP \fIaction\fP"
Sets the action to take if \fBipfrag\fP encounters a packet that
requires fragmentation but the packet is an IPv4 packet with the Don't
Fragment bit set.  If \fIaction\fP is "pass", then \fBipfrag\fP passes
the packet through unmodified.  If \fIaction\fP is "drop", then
\fBipfrag\fP will drop the packet.  If \fIaction\fP is "frag", then
\fBipfrag\fP will fragment the packet despite the Don't Fragment bit.
The resulting fragments will have the Don't Fragment bit set in this
case.
.IP \fB-d\fP
If this option is specified then \fBipfrag\fP will set the Don't
Fragment bit on every fragment that it generates.  ( \fBipfrag\fP will
not alter the Don't Fragment bits of packets that it doesn't fragment.)
.IP \fB-h\fP
Print the usage of the command and exit.
.IP "\fB-m\fP \fImtu\fP"
Set the MTU for fragmentation.  This is the maximum size of a packet
starting with its IPv4 or IPv6 header.  The default MTU as 1500 bytes.
\fBipfrag\fP will exit with an error if \fImtu\fP is less than the
minimum MTU for a protocol that it must fragment.  This is 68 bytes if
\fBipfrag\fP must fragment IPv4 packets and 1280 bytes if \fBipfrag\fP
must fragment IPv6 packets.
.IP \fB-4\fP
Fragment IPv4 packets.
.IP \fB-6\fP
Fragment IPv6 packets.
.P
.SH EXAMPLES
Fragment the IPv4 packets only in a stream with an IPv4 MTU of 576
bytes.
.nf

	ipfrag -m 576 input.xpkt output.xpkt

.fi
Fragment IPv4 datagrams at an MTU of 600 bytes and IPv6 datagrams at an
MTU of 1280 bytes.  Set the Don't Fragment bit on newly created IPv4
fragments.
.nf

	ipfrag -4 -m 600 input.xpkt | ipfrag -6 -m 1280 > output.xpkt

.fi
Fragment all packets coming in eth0 and send them out eth1 and visa
versa at an MTU of 800 bytes.  This basically creates a fragmenting
bridge between eth0 and eth1.
.nf

	pktin -I eth0 | ipfrag -m 800 | pktout eth1 &
	pktin -I eth1 | ipfrag -m 800 | pktout eth0 &

.fi
.SH AVAILABILITY
This utility should be available on all supported ONICS platforms.
